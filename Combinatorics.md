# Combinatorics

- **Burnside's Lemma**: The number of unique objects from a set of objects under a group of transformations is the sum of unique objects under each transformation divided by the number of transformations (e.g. the number of unique necklaces under rotation is the sum of unique necklaces under each rotation divided by the number of rotations).

- **Stars And Bars**: If you have to split $n$ identical objects into $k$ groups, there are $\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}$ ways to do so (e.g the number of ways to split 10 identical objects into 3 groups is $\binom{10+3-1}{3-1} = \binom{12}{2} = 66$).
